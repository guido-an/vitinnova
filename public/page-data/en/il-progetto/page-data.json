To limit or cancel the use of copper in organic viticulture using alternative products in the anti-mildew protection of the vineyard for the production of wine grapes","action2":"Action 2. To optimize cultivation (defoliation, harvesting) and the use of agrochemicals and fertilizers with techniques of precision farming (Moderna, moncaro, belisario, UNIVPM)","action3":"Action 3. To apply new cultivation techniques for adaptation to the changed climate context on the basis of early monitoring of the progress of ripening (Moderna, moncaro, belisario, UNIVPM)","action4":"Action 4. Development of technologies for the vinification of organic grapes for wines without added sulphites and low H2S content","action5":"Action 5. Development of winemaking techniques of organic grapes to produce wines with reduced sulphite content","action6":"Action 6. Dissemination of project activities","action7":"Action 7. Coordination and administrative management of the working group."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true,"locale":"en"}}}
