In the agri-food sector, the UNIVPM involves at least 30 research groups, mainly belonging to, but not limited to, the D3A, with multidisciplinary competences that concern environmental and economic sustainability, adaptation to climate change, food production processes, food quality and safety, nutrition and health, biodiversity protection, genetic improvement, etc.","p4":"The general Arboricultura and tree crops sector of the D3A has for some time activated research lines in viticulture concerning the relationships between climate change, phenology and the progress of ripening of the grape, the adaption cultivation strategies to the new climate and the consequent development of innovative cultivation techniques, the evaluation and management of the efficiency of the vineyards, the regulation of the vigour of the vines and the progress of ripening.","p5":"The scientific dissemination activity, carried out both internationally and nationally through specialized publishing, is completed with the transfer of innovation in university education and in the conference activity. In the Patalogia vegetale sector of D3A, strategies for the protection from the downy mildew of the vine in organic agriculture alternatives to the use of copper have been studied for years.","p6":"The activities of the researchers of the D3A also cover a number of experimental and demonstration evidences conducted at the Azienda Agraria of the Università Politecnica delle Marche in the different sectors of agronomy and cultivation, including viticulture, which constitute not only an effective system for transferring innovation during the training process (field exercises aimed at students), but also represent a fundamental transfer vehicle of innovation to the productive sector (visits to experimental fields, demonstration days).","p7":"In the context of agri-food and environmental microbiology, the DiSVA research group actively collaborates from several years with the wine companies of the region through experimental wine-making evidences aimed at applying and transferring research activities developed at laboratory level by researchers in the oenological field. The UNIVPM participated with the Cooperativa Agricola Moncaro and CIA in the setting-up VITINNOVA project, which has the Cooperativa Moderna as its leading partner."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true,"locale":"en"}}}
